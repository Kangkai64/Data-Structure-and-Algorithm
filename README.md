# TAR UMT Clinic Management System

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Java-based Clinic Management System developed for Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology (TAR UMT). The system effectively models one-to-many relationships using custom Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and follows the ECB (Entity-Control-Boundary) pattern.

## Problem Statement

TAR UMT is establishing an on-campus clinic to provide medical care for students. The system allows students to:
- Book appointments or walk-ins for doctor consultations
- Make payments
- Get medicines
- Access various clinic functions

The system effectively models one-to-many relationships using collection ADTs and demonstrates creativity and competence in implementation.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Java 23** - Core programming language
- **Maven** - Dependency management and build tool
- **MySQL** - Database management system
- **HikariCP** - Connection pooling
- **Custom ADTs** - No use of java.util.Collection libraries

### Architecture Pattern
- **ECB Pattern** (Entity-Control-Boundary)
- **Layered Architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **DAO Pattern** for data access operations

## Database Schema

### Tables Created
1. **address** - Address information
2. **person** - Base table for patients and doctors
3. **patient** - Patient-specific information
4. **doctor** - Doctor-specific information
5. **schedule** - Doctor duty schedules
6. **consultation** - Patient consultations
7. **medical_treatment** - Treatment records
8. **medicine** - Medicine inventory
9. **prescription** - Prescription records
10. **prescribed_medicine** - Junction table for prescriptions and medicines

### ID Generation Triggers
- **Patient IDs**: P000000001, P000000002, etc.
- **Doctor IDs**: D000000001, D000000002, etc.
- **Consultation IDs**: C000000001, C000000002, etc.
- **Treatment IDs**: T000000001, T000000002, etc.
- **Medicine IDs**: M000000001, M000000002, etc.
- **Prescription IDs**: PR00000001, PR00000002, etc.

### Database Features
- **Foreign Key Constraints** - Maintains data integrity
- **Indexes** - Optimized for performance
- **Triggers** - Automatic ID generation and status updates
- **Views** - Common query abstractions
- **Sample Data** - Pre-populated for testing

## Reporting Features

Each module includes at least 2 summary reports:

### Patient Management Reports

CREATE TRIGGER tr_patient_id_generation
BEFORE INSERT ON patient
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.patientId IS NULL OR NEW.patientId = '' THEN
        SET NEW.patientId = CONCAT('P', LPAD((SELECT COUNT(*) + 1 FROM patient), 9, '0'));
    END IF;
END
```

### Status Updates
```sql
-- Example: Medicine status based on stock
CREATE TRIGGER tr_medicine_status_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON medicine
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.quantityInStock = 0 THEN
        SET NEW.status = 'OUT_OF_STOCK';
    ELSEIF NEW.quantityInStock <= NEW.minimumStockLevel THEN
        SET NEW.status = 'LOW_STOCK';
    ELSE
        SET NEW.status = 'AVAILABLE';
    END IF;
END
```
